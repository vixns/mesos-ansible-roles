About Runit
------------

Runit is a simple service runner who intention is to keep a service running always, 
even if it crashes. A service is defined as an executable that runs on a server.

The way that a runit service is configured, where {{service_name}} is the name of the service that you 
create, is as follows:

Config Files:

/etc/sv/{{service_name}}/run
/etc/sv/{{service_name}}/log/run

The file named 'run' is typically a shell script to launch the executable for your service.

A simple common run file looks like:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

exec 2>&1
exec chpst -e /etc/sv/{{ service_name }}/env -u {{ service_user }} {{ service_command }}

```

A simple rolling log service file looks like:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

exec chpst -u {{ service_user }} svlogd -tt /var/log/{{ service_name }}

```

To enable a service a symlink is created as follows (disabling is simply removing the symlink):

/etc/service/{{service_name}} ------> /etc/sv/{{service_name}}

To manually start a service:

```
  sudo sv start {{service_Name}}
```

To manually get the service status:

```
  sudo sv status {{service_Name}}
```

Task Comments
----------------

If auto='yes' the above config files will be created for you and you'll need to set the 'command' to run and the 'user' to run the service under.

If you would like to control the details of the files, simply set auto='no', enabled='no', create the two run files and place 
them in the correct service location (/etc/sv/{{service_name}}/run ...).  For your convenience the file
config paths are returned as 'run_service_file' and 'log_service_file'. After your custom run files are in place set enabled='yes', state='up'.


Example Playbook
----------------
See test.yml for a working version.

    - hosts: servers
	  sudo: true

      roles:
         - { role: gotansible.runit }

	  tasks:
      - name: place file to run
        copy: src=testrun.sh dest=/opt/runme mode=0755

      - name: create log dir
        file: state=directory path=/var/log/myservice

      - name: test runit
        runit: name=myservice enabled=true state=up timeout=9 user='root' command='bash /opt/runme'
		register: myservice_status
	  
### handler.yml
	  - name: restart myservice
		runit: name=myservice enabled=true state=up timeout=9 action=restart
		when: not myservice_status.restarted
